# DevTools Drawer Ideas

A comprehensive developer tools system designed specifically for applet development workflows. The devtools drawer provides essential debugging and testing capabilities without cluttering the main UI.

## Core Architecture

**Implementation Pattern:**
- Slide-out drawer (right side preferred)
- Feature flag controlled (`REACT_APP_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS`)
- Persistent across navigation (stays open while working)
- Organized into expandable/collapsible sections
- Uses sessionStorage for temporary state, localStorage for preferences

**Access Control:**
- Only visible in development mode or with explicit feature flag
- Could also be enabled per-user in production for testing/support scenarios

## User & Identity Tools

### 1. User Impersonation
**Purpose**: Test different user perspectives without separate accounts

**Features:**
