## **TICKET-001: Implement Dynamic Token System with Developer Tools**

### **Type:** Epic
### **Priority:** High
### **Status:** Complete

### **Description:**
Implement a comprehensive token system that allows runtime token overrides with developer tools integration for design system management.

### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create TokenEditor component with real-time token modification capabilities
- [x] Implement token override system using `window.__tokenOverrides`
- [x] Add token cache management and clearing functionality
- [x] Build dev console integration for token debugging
- [x] Create CSS variable injection system for dynamic theme updates
- [x] Implement proper theme recreation without render loops
- [x] Add dark/light mode switching with token persistence

### **Technical Implementation:**
- Built `TokenEditor.tsx` with createModifiedTheme functionality
- Implemented `DevContext.tsx` with safe theme setting mechanisms
- Added CSS variable injection via `injectTokenCssVars`
- Created token resolution system using `resolveTokenReference`
- Fixed infinite render loops and network request loops
- Added localStorage persistence for theme preferences

### **Related Commits:**
- `dd11c93` - Token editor improvements and import/export fixes
- `0a7b54d` - Comprehensive token system overhaul and dev tools enhancement
- `b9a003c` - Enhanced dev console and role management features

## **TICKET-002: Create Simplified CSS Variable Theme Architecture**

### **Type:** Story
### **Priority:** Medium
### **Status:** Complete

### **Description:**
Design and implement a simplified MUI theme architecture using CSS custom properties to eliminate theme duplication and enable dynamic token updates.

### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create single theme that works for both light and dark modes
- [x] Implement CSS variables for all design tokens
- [x] Build proxy-based token system with IDE autocomplete
- [x] Enable property access for CSS variables (`ui.prop` → `"var(--ui-prop)"`)
- [x] Enable function calls for resolved values (`ui.prop()` → actual value)
- [x] Create utilities for dynamic CSS variable updates
- [x] Demonstrate token override capabilities

### **Technical Implementation:**
- Built `mui-components/src/theme/simpler/` architecture
- Created proxy system with toString() for CSS variables
- Implemented function call interface for value resolution
- Added utilities for theme mode switching and token overrides
- Created comprehensive demo with working examples
- Eliminated separate light/dark theme files

### **Benefits:**
- Reduced theme complexity from 6+ files to 4 focused files
- Enabled instant token updates without theme recreation
- Provided clean syntax: `ui.input.base.default.background`
- Maintained full TypeScript autocomplete support

### **Related Commits:**
- Work completed in current session (theme/simpler implementation)
- Various token system improvements throughout the period
