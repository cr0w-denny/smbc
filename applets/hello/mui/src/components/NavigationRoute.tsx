            Hash Navigation in SMBC Applets

            How It Works
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            SMBC applets use <strong>hash-based navigation</strong> to
            manage routing within and between applets. When you navigate
            between routes, notice how the URL changes to include hash
            fragments like <b>#/hello/route-one</b> or{" "}
            <b>#/user-management?page=2&search=john</b>.

            Route Exposure Architecture
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Applets expose their internal navigation structure to host
            applications through the <b>getHostNavigation</b> export. This
            allows hosts to build navigation menus, breadcrumbs, and
            implement programmatic navigation while respecting
            permission-based route filtering.
