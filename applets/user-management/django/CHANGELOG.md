# @smbc/user-management-django

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Enhanced applets with shared component integration and improved user experience:
  - Integrated shared MUI components (LoadingTable, SearchInput, EmptyState, ConfirmationDialog)
  - Replaced duplicate UI patterns with standardized components
  - Added debounced search functionality to both user and product tables
  - Improved loading states with skeleton animations
  - Enhanced empty states with actionable content and better messaging
  - Standardized confirmation dialogs for delete operations

  These changes improve consistency across all applets while reducing code duplication and maintenance overhead.
