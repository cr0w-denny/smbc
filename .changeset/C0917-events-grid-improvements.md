Enhanced Events grid with default sorting, column visibility, and status formatting improvements

- Added default sort order: event category, event date, obligor (ascending)
- Hidden "Trigger Values" column by default to reduce clutter
- Changed lifecycle status chips from ALL UPPERCASE to Mixed Case formatting
- Set default date filters: from = today - 1 month, to = today
- Cleaned up unused icon imports (SendIcon, CancelScheduledSendIcon, NewspaperIcon)
